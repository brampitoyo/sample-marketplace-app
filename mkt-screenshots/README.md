# Get Started

1. First of all, you must enable a screen size by creating a folder with the appropriate name. The acceptable folder names are:
    * `/mobile`
    * `/tablet`
    * `/desktop`
2. Put your image and video files inside the appropriate folders. See below for quantity, dimensions, file format and sorting/ordering

# Sorting files

Sorting files is easy. Simply prefix each filename with a dot-separated number. The app landing page will follow the order you have established.

For example:
1. 1.timeline-screen.png
2. 2.demo-video.webm
3. 3.another-screenshot.jpg
