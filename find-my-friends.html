	  <h1>Find My Friends</h1>
		<p>Find My Friends is an app made by Tiny Kiwi Studio (http://www.tiny-kiwi.com/).</p>
		<p>What it does:
		  <ul>
		    <li>Aggregate your friend’s contact information from the phone’s address book</li>
		    <li>Send you a notification when your location is nearby them, and when they’re running the app, too</li>
		  </ul>
		<p>Find My Friends is going to be sold in United States, Colombia, Argentina and Mexico. It goes without saying that the app’s listing will need to be translated to Spanish. Feel free to run your made-up description through <a href="https://translate.google.com" target="_blank">Google Translate</a> to do this.</p>
